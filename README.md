# WW3Launcher
A new launcher for the game World War 3

For now this repository is just a placeholder until it is ready.

## What will it do?
I plan for this to first be a website which shows the current servers and allows players to connect to them. Then I would like to implement a squad system and other improvements utilising steam authentication.
